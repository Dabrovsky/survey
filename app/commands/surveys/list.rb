# Extracting logic into commands at this stage isnâ€™t necessary, especially for a task of this size.
# However, I wanted to point out that doing so is beneficial, as it makes future development easier
# and helps maintain a consistent approach to separating business logic.
#
# For example, if we want to implement additional filters in the future,
# we could do that easily inside the command instead of the controller or model.
